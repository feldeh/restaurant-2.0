# Restaurant Bootstrap Website

This is a restaurant website project built using Bootstrap in order to practice my website design skills.
<br/><br/>

## Technologies used:

- **Bootstrap**
- **CSS**
- **JS**
- **Figma**
- **Google Map API**

<br/>

I used Figma for the wireframing, which can be accessed through [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/JjLgqok2QPrc5ifO90Kjcl/Bootstrap-Restaurant?node-id=0%3A1).

The website was deployed using github page and can be consulted [here](https://feldeh.github.io/restaurant-css-framework/).
